944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted (Easy)
Problem
You are given an array of strings strs, all with the same length.
Think of them as rows in a grid. A column is sorted lexicographically if reading it from top to bottom is non-decreasing.
Return how many columns are not sorted and therefore must be deleted.


Key Idea
Check each column independently.
For a column c, compare characters in adjacent rows:
	•	if at any point strs[r][c] > strs[r+1][c], the column is not sorted
	•	count it as a deletion and stop checking that column (early break)

Example
strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Grid:
c b a
d a f
g h i
	•	Column 0: c <= d <= g sorted
	•	Column 1: b > a not sorted → delete
	•	Column 2: a <= f <= i sorted
Answer = 1

Complexity
	•	Time: O(n * m) where n = len(strs) and m = len(strs[0])
	•	Space: O(1)
