Intuition

I observe that a smooth descent period is a contiguous sequence where each next price is exactly 1 lower than the previous one.
Every single day by itself is always a valid descent period.

Instead of checking all subarrays, I focus on how many valid periods end at each day.

Key Idea

If on day i:
	•	prices[i] == prices[i-1] - 1
→ the descent continues, so all descent periods ending at day i-1 can be extended
	•	otherwise
→ the descent breaks and a new one starts at day i

I keep a variable length:
	•	length = length of the current smooth descent ending at day i
	•	the number of valid descent periods ending at day i is exactly length

I add length to the answer for every day.

Example

For prices = [3,2,1,4]
	•	Day 0 → length = 1 → [3]
	•	Day 1 → 2 = 3 - 1 → length = 2 → [2], [3,2]
	•	Day 2 → 1 = 2 - 1 → length = 3 → [1], [2,1], [3,2,1]
	•	Day 3 → break → length = 1 → [4]

Total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7

⸻

Algorithm
	1.	Initialize length = 0 and answer = 0
	2.	Iterate through the prices:
	•	If the current price continues a -1 descent → increment length
	•	Otherwise → reset length = 1
	3.	Add length to answer
	4.	Return answer
