# Maximize Happiness of Selected Children (LeetCode 3075)

## Problem
You are given an array `happiness`, where each value represents a child’s happiness, and an integer `k`.
You select exactly `k` children one by one. After each selection, the happiness of all remaining children decreases by 1 (but not below 0).
The goal is to maximize the total happiness of the selected children.

**Input:** `happiness: List[int]`, `k: int`
**Output:** `int`

## Key Idea
The best strategy is to always select the child with the highest current happiness.
Since every selection decreases the remaining happiness values by 1, picking larger values earlier minimizes the loss.
After sorting the array in descending order, the effective happiness of the `i`-th picked child becomes
`max(happiness[i] - i, 0)`.

## Approach
1. Sort the `happiness` array in descending order.
2. Iterate over the first `k` elements.
3. For each index `i`, add `max(happiness[i] - i, 0)` to the result.

## Complexity
- Time: **O(n log n)** (due to sorting)
- Space: **O(1)** extra space (in-place sorting)

## Edge Cases
- When all happiness values drop to 0 before selecting `k` children.
- When `k = 1` (just pick the maximum).
- Large happiness values with large `n`.

## Solution (Python)
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumHappinessSum(self, happiness: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        happiness.sort(reverse=True)
        total = 0
        for i in range(k):
            total += max(happiness[i] - i, 0)
        return total
