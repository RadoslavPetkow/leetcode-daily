955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II — Explanation (Greedy)
Problem
We have n strings of equal length. We may delete some columns (same indices in every string). After deletions, the array must be lexicographically non-decreasing:
strs[0] <= strs[1] <= ... <= strs[n-1]
Return the minimum number of deleted columns.

Key Insight
When comparing strs[i] and strs[i+1], the final lexicographic result is decided by the first column where they differ (among the columns we keep).
So while scanning columns left → right:
	•	Some adjacent pairs (i, i+1) are still “undecided”
	•	Once we find a kept column where strs[i][c] < strs[i+1][c], that pair is permanently sorted, and future columns cannot break it anymore.

Strategy
Maintain an array fixed[i]:
	•	fixed[i] = True means strs[i] < strs[i+1] is already guaranteed by previous kept columns.
For each column c:
	1.	Check if keeping it breaks order for any unresolved pair:
	•	If there exists i with not fixed[i] and strs[i][c] > strs[i+1][c]
	•	Then we must delete this column (otherwise order becomes impossible).
	2.	If it’s safe to keep:
	•	For every unresolved pair with strs[i][c] < strs[i+1][c], set fixed[i] = True.

This is optimal because:
	•	We only delete a column when it must be deleted (it would break lexicographic order immediately).

Complexity
	•	Time: O(n * m)
	•	Space: O(n)
Where n = number of strings, m = length of each string.
