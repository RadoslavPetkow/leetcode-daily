Hint
You are given an integer array prices representing the daily price history of a stock, where prices[i] is the stock price on the ith day.

A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day by exactly 1. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 ≠ 1.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
1 <= prices[i] <= 105

Approach

We count how many valid “smooth descent” subarrays end at each index.

Key idea:
	•	Let len = length of the current smooth descent streak ending at day i.
	•	If prices[i-1] - prices[i] == 1, then the streak continues: len += 1.
	•	Otherwise, the streak breaks and restarts: len = 1.

Why this works:
	•	If a streak ending at i has length len, then there are exactly len smooth descent periods that end at i:
	•	the 1-length period [prices[i]]
	•	the 2-length period [prices[i-1], prices[i]] (if valid)
	•	…
	•	the len-length period covering the whole streak.

So we add len to the answer for each i.

Why This Solution
	•	It avoids checking all subarrays (which would be too slow).
	•	It uses a single pass and a running streak length, which is the minimal info needed.
	•	Works efficiently up to 1e5 days.

Complexity
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)
	•	Space Complexity: O(1)
