Delete Columns to Make Sorted III (LeetCode 960)
Problem
You are given n strings of equal length. You may delete any set of column indices, removing those characters from every string.
After deletions, each individual string must be lexicographically non-decreasing.
Return the minimum number of columns to delete to achieve this.
Input: Array of strings strs
Output: Integer (minimum deletions)

Key Idea
Instead of deciding which columns to delete, we decide which columns to keep.
Two columns i < j can both be kept if and only if for every row r,
strs[r][i] <= strs[r][j].
This transforms the problem into finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) over columns, where the comparison must hold across all rows.
The final answer is:
total_columns − longest_valid_column_sequence.

Approach
	1.	Let m be the number of columns.
	2.	Use DP where dp[j] = length of the longest valid column sequence ending at column j.
	3.	For every pair of columns (i, j) with i < j, check if column i can come before j in all rows.
	4.	Update dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1) if valid.
	5.	Subtract the maximum LIS length from m to get the minimum deletions.

Complexity
	•	Time: O(n · m²)
	•	Space: O(m)

Where n = number of rows, m = number of columns.

Edge Cases
	•	Single string (must be sorted individually)
	•	All rows already sorted → answer is 0
	•	Completely decreasing columns → delete all but one column
