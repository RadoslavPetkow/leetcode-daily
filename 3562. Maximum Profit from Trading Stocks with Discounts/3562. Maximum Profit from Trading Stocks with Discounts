A smooth descent period is basically a run where each next price is exactly -1 from the previous.

Key observation

If you’re at index i and prices[i-1] - prices[i] == 1, then you can extend the previous descent streak.
Let len = length of current valid descent streak ending at i.
	•	If condition holds → len += 1
	•	Else → len = 1

How many smooth descent subarrays end at i? Exactly len (all suffixes of that streak).
So answer is sum(len over all i).

Example: [3,2,1,4]
	•	i=0: len=1 → +1
	•	i=1: 3→2 diff=1 len=2 → +2
	•	i=2: 2→1 diff=1 len=3 → +3
	•	i=3: 1→4 diff!=1 len=1 → +1
Total = 1+2+3+1 = 7
